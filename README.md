# Welcome to TaraMentai 👋

This is my **alt account** ~ a space for experiments, random ideas, and the kinds of projects I wouldn’t dare post elsewhere.  
As for my **main account**... well, that’s a secret wrapped in mystery.  
Over there, I’m a bit too hesitant to be *truly* creative. 😶‍🌫️

I’m from somewhere—but do you *really* know where? The mystery lingers. 🕵️‍♂️  
Also, I love sushi. 🍣
